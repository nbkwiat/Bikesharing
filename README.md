## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use data gathered from public citibike sharing to display a visual analysis using Tableau. Primarily we are looking at data by gender.

## Results

The average amount of time people checkout their bike is typically 10-20 minutes with nothing really ever going over an hour.

You can tell from the breakdown graph that More men then women are checking out the bikes.

according to the heatmap Most bikes are taken out at 7am and 6pm. We can infer that this is for a daily commute to work.

You can see from this heatmap that both males and females checkout the bikes around the same times just more men check them out then women.

People generally favor having a subscription to citibike and more men then women have subscriptions. Im sure this is due to pricing.

## Summary

We can see from the data that most peole are taking the bikes to and from work. It also appears that Men are more likely to checkout a bike then women. Men are also more likely to subscribe then women. A possible visualization that could be performed is cost based on subscription or standard rental. This could tell us a little more on why single paying customers are not subscribing. Another analysis that can be preformed is what areas are there less bicycle accidents and maybe that could be a good place to distribute more citibikes.
